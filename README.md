# ABOUT_ME

I'm a dedicated third-year B.C.A. student currently engaged in distance learning. With a solid foundation in VFX gained from two years of industry experience, I'm now transitioning my career towards data analysis and data science.

Having successfully balanced my previous VFX role with my studies, I'm eager to focus on my academic pursuits and apply my analytical skills to a data-driven field. I'm actively upskilling through online courses and seeking opportunities to leverage my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail in an internship or entry-level data analyst position.

With my B.C.A. degree nearing completion, I'm highly motivated to embark on a career in data analysis. I'm confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to a team and am eager to grow my expertise in this exciting field.I'm a dedicated third-year B.C.A. student currently engaged in distance learning.
